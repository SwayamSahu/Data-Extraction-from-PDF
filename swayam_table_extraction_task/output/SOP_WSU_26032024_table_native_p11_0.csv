,,Dealing Assistant will scan the JD, and it
will be further processed in the FO
interface as mentioned in Para 6 above,
with the option to revert the request to
the establishment for any query online.
In case there is more than one nominee
in Form-2, then the consent of all
nominees/family members/Legal heirs
will be required for filing the JD request.
The rest of the process remains the
same.
