1.,Average
Profits
Methods,Under this method -
Value of Goodwill = Agreed Number of Years (Purchase) × Average
Maintainable Profits
Average Maintainable/Profit
Average Annual Profits 00
[Simple average or may be weighted
average considering the trend of profits]
Less: “Exceptional/Casual Income 00
Add: Abnormal Loss 00
00
Add: Capital Expenditure wrongly charged against profits 00
00
Less: Provision for Taxation (As may be required) 00
Adjusted Maintainable Profits 000
(“Adjustments for undercharged or overcharged Depreciation or
under or over valuation of stocks to be made, if required),(i) If profits are fluctuating, simple
average is taken. If profits show an
increasing trend, weights may be
used.
If profits constantly decrease,
the lowest of the profits after
adjustments may be considered.
(ii) Exceptional Income or Expense of
any particular year, should better
be adjusted against the profit of
that year.
(iii) More weightage is usually given to
later years.
2.,Super Profits
Method,Super Profit = Future maintainable profits – Normal Return on Capital
Employed
Goodwill = Super Profit × No. of years
Steps to be followed
Steps (a) Calculation of Capital employed OR Average
Capital Employed,(i) Calculation of Average capital
Employed cannot be made if
current years’ profits are not
separately given.
(ii) Trading Profits exclude any non
trading income like Interest on Non-
trading investments.
(iii) Adjustments against profits
including provision for managerial
remuneration, should be made.
[iv) If there is any change in the value
of any fixed asset on revaluation,
that does not affect Annual
Trading Profit. But adjustment for
over charged or undercharged
depreciation may be required to
adjust the profits.
(v) If there is any decrease in the value
of any Current Asset like bad debts
or reduction of stock and that has
not been adjusted, the adjustment
should be made for finding out
correct Trading Profit of the current
year.
(vi) For calculating capital employed,
proposed dividend need not be
deducted.

should be added back with Profits before making provision for
taxation
Step (c) Calculate Normal Return on Capital Employed or Average
Capital Employed
[Say at 10% or 12%, etc. — as may be given or assumed]
Step(d) Deduct Normal Return (c) from Average Maintainable Profits
(b).
The difference is called Annual Super Profit
Step (e) Goodwill = Annual Super Profit × No. of Years for which the
Super Profit can be maintained.
