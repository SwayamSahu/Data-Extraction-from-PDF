Voucher Posting,Entries in the personal ledger are made directly from vouchers instead of being
posted from the books of prime entry.
Voucher Summary
Sheets,The vouchers entered into different personal ledgers each day are summarised
on summary sheets, totals of which are posted to the control accounts in the
general ledger.
Daily Trial Balance,The general ledger trial balance is extracted and agreed everyday.
Continuous Checks,All entries in the detailed personal ledgers and summary sheets are checked
by persons other than those who have made the entries. A considerable
force of such check is employed, with the general result that most clerical
mistakes are detected before another day begins.
Control Accounts,A trial balance of the detailed personal ledgers is prepared periodically,
usually every two weeks, agreed with general ledger control accounts.
Double Voucher
System,Two vouchers are prepared for every transaction not involving cash-one debit
voucher and another credit voucher.
