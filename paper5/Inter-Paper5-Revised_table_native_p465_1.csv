3.,Capitalization
of Profits
Methods
(A) Profits
(B) Capi-
talization of
Super Profits,Under the method follow these steps –
(a) Calculate Annual Maintainable Profit as shown above.
(b) Calculate normal Capital Employed capitalizing the above
profit by applying the normal rate of return.
Maintainable Profit
Normal Capital Employed = × 100
Normal Rate of Return
(c) Calculate actual Capital Employed
(d) Goodwill = Normal Capital Employed – Actual capital
Employed.
(a) Calculate Super profit as said under Method 2.
Super Profit
(b) Goodwill = × 100
Normal Rate of Return,Here also the profits should be adjusted
considering necessary adjustments for
managerial remunerations, change of
depreciation, etc.
4.,Annuity
Method,It is a derivative of super profit concept. If super profit is expected to
be earned uniformly over a number of years, Goodwill is computed
with the help of Annuity Table.
Calculate Super Profit as discussed before
Goodwill=Annual Super ProfitxPresent Value of Annuity of `1.
If Interest rate for calculating annuity table is given, the following
formula may be applied —
a a 1 
V= i  1−(1+i)−n   OR= i   1− (1+i)n  
V = Value of Goodwill n = No. of years
a = Annual Super Profit i = rate of interest,Here also similar principles as said
before should be followed for
calculating — Capital Employed or
Average Capital Employed, Annual
Average Profits and Annual Super
Profits.
