1.,Valuation of Goodwill
Average Annual Profits of last 3 years = (` 5,000 + 4000 + 4500)/3 = ` 4500
2.,Goodwill = ` 4,500 × 2 = ` 9,000
3.,Goodwill to be raised = New Value – Book Value = ` 9,000 – Nil = ` 9,000.
It is to be raised in Old Ratio and written off in new ratio. So sacrifice ratio is not required.
